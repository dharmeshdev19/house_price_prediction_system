# House Price Prediction System

## Project Description


A system that predicts house prices in Mumbai using Machine Learning Regression Techniques. 

In order to build this project, I first scraped the data from CommonFloor Website. I have included the data in a csv file. 

The repo contains a jupyter notebook, where I showed how I build the model step by step, and how I have tackled with missing data, feature engineering.

Feel free to connect with me for any feedback to improvise on the model.
